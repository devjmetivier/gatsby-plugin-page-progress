Add a page progress indicator to your Gatsby project 😎
The progress bar moves as you scroll down the page.

> Useful for blog sites and other reading material so users know how far they've read into an article or page.

## [Install](#install)

`npm i gatsby-plugin-page-progress`

## [Options Example](#options-example)

Inside `gatsby-config.js`

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-page-progress",
    options: {
      includePaths: ["/", { regex: "^/blog" }],
      excludePaths: ["/blog/beep-beep-lettuce"],
      height: 3,
      prependToBody: false,
      color: `#663399`
    }
  }
];
```

If you'd like the progression bar to appear on all pages of your project,
you can simply add the name of the plugin to your plugins array in `gatsby-config.js`

```js
plugins: ["gatsby-plugin-page-progress"];
```

## [Options](#options)

#### `includePaths`

Required: ❌

Accepts: `[string | object]`

Default: `[]`

> Supports multiple paths. This option enables the plugin to include an array of paths. You can use regex to define multiple path inclusions. **See examples below**

#### `excludePaths`

Required: ❌

Accepts: `[string | object]`

Default: `[]`

> Supports multiple paths. This option enables the plugin to exclude an array of paths. You can use regex to multiple path exclusions. Defining paths to exclude will take precedence over `includePath` definitions. **See examples below**

#### `prependToBody`

Required: ❌

Accepts: `boolean`

Default: `false`

> If `false`, the bar is appended to the `<body>`. If `true`, the bar is prepended to the `<body>`.

#### `height`

Required: ❌

Accepts: `number`

Default: `3`

> Sets the `height` of the progress bar.

#### `color`

Required: ❌

Accepts: `string`

Default: `#663399`

> Sets the `color` of the progress bar.

## [Examples](#examples)

#### Only include the root path:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-page-progress",
    options: {
      includePaths: ["/"],
      excludePaths: []
    }
  }
];
```

#### Include the root path, plus all paths under the `/blog` route:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-page-progress",
    options: {
      includePaths: ["/", { regex: "^/blog" }],
      excludePaths: []
    }
  }
];
```

> This plugin calls the constructor function for [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#Creating_a_regular_expression). That's why we define any regex that we want to use inside an object. For more information on how to write regular expressions using the RegExp constructor use [MDN for reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#Description).

#### Exclude only the root path:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-page-progress",
    options: {
      includePaths: [],
      excludePaths: ["/"]
    }
  }
];
```

#### Include the root path, plus every path under the `/blog` route, but exclude a specific path under `/blog`:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-page-progress",
    options: {
      includePaths: ["/", { regex: "^/blog" }],
      excludePaths: ["/blog/awesome/article"]
    }
  }
];
```

#### Include the root path, plus all paths under the `/blog` route, but exclude all paths under `/blog` that end with `'react'`':

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-page-progress",
    options: {
      includePaths: ["/", { regex: "^/blog" }],
      excludePaths: [{ regex: "^/blog.+react$" }]
    }
  }
];
```

> Remember that exclusions always take precedence over inclusions. In the case above - If the plugin finds any path that begins with `/blog` and ends with `react` it will not apply the progress indicator because it already knows to exclude that route 😁 Inversely, if we were on a route under `/blog` that didn't end with `react`, it would apply the progress indicator because the exclusion rule wouldn't apply to that route.
